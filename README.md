Just got out of Lilo & Stitch, and my brain’s doing cartwheels. Not in the graceful gymnast way—more like how I imagine a raccoon might try to juggle flaming pineapples. I mean, I went in for a kids’   and sort of came out with the taste of marshmallows mixed with sea salt and maybe a dash of existential dread?

Look, Lilo and her crazy alien dog-thing, Stitch, they just kind of bulldoze into your heart, right? Like, I’m not sure how a blue fluffy menace and a tiny Hawaiian girl managed that, but here we are. One minute you're in paradise with tropical colors like an Instagram filter with a sunburn, the next you’re like, wait, who let all the space junk in? I swear they dropped an alien acid trip into my popcorn.

Oh, and the music—Elvis?! Oh yeah, because what better way to complement an intergalactic escapade than with some pelvis-thrusting rock and roll? Honestly, I didn’t realize I needed to see a little girl teaching her demon dog buddy to play ukulele and do the hound dog until now. It’s like Disney’s been reading my subconscious diary. Weird flex, Mickey, but okay.

> Is it just me, or did that social worker guy, Cobra Bubbles—yeah, Cobra Bubbles, I know—seem like he walked straight out of a noir 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮? I could practically hear the jazzy saxophone every time he was on screen. Like dude, what’s your deal? Also, random alien councilwoman, why do you look like my aunt Gertrude? What's the hidden message here, Disney?

At one point, Stitch snatching away a little girl’s family isn’t child-friendly, right? But then they're running from those men-in-black dudes, and somehow, it’s as heartwarming as hot cocoa on an Alaskan cruise. Probably just my inner child clinging to tropes again, who knows.

And that scenery, oh man. I think those animators need a nap after painting every frond and wave with such detail—seriously, Hawaii tourism must be raking it in. Makes you want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to pause a frame and sigh at it like a digital postcard.

Anyway, if you want to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , buckle up for some emotional whiplash and a lot of random tears. Take tissues, and maybe a surfboard. Just in case.
